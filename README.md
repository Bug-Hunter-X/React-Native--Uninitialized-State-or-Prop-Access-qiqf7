This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug: accessing state or props before they are initialized. This often occurs during asynchronous operations, such as API calls, where the component renders before the data is available.  The solution showcases how to use the `useEffect` hook and conditional rendering to handle this scenario effectively. The bug and solution are shown in separate files.
